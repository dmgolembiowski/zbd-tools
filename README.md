  PIP is already included*

**NOTE:** PIP is required only if *install from source* is not preferred.

## Installation 

To install and uninstall *zbd-tools* utilities, the project *Makefile* can be
used. Installation from the Python Package Index using the pip package manager
is also possible.

### Installation Using *make*

To install *zbd-tools* utilities execute the following command as root.

```
# make install
Installing zbd-check
```

To uninstall *zbd-tools* utilities execute the following command as root.

```
# make uninstall
Uninstalling zbd-check
```

### Installation Using *pip*

A PIP package for *zbd-tools* is provided by the Python Package Index (pypi).
For users who prefer not to install from the source tree using *make*, the
following command can be executed (eventually as root) to fetch and install the
*zbd-tools* package from pypi.

```

## Usage

*zbd-tools* provides the *zbd-check* utility to check the zoned block device
features and applications supported by a Linux distribution.

### *zbd-check*

This utility allows checking a Linux distribution for zoned block device
support. Three different class of features are checked:
1. Kernel features: device types, device mapper targets and file systems support
   are checked.
2. User Libraries: *zbd-check* will list the installation status of user
   libraries related to zoned block devices.
3. User Applications: *zbd-check* will list the installation status of user
   applications related to zoned block devices.

*zbd-check* command line usage is displayed using the option "--help".

```
$ zbd-check --help
usage: zbd-check.py [-h] [--version]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --version   show the version of zbd-check
```

The following shows an example output of the *zbd-check* utility executed on a
system running Fedora Linux 37.
